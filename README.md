# Randomizr

Randomizr is an Electron-based desktop application that randomly displays images from a root folder. It allows you to resize them and arrange them in various ways, and save the random configurations for later viewing. For those of us who have accumulated a lot of pictures over the years, it's a fun tool for taking a random trip down memory lane.

This was mostly just a toy project to play with Electron and use Vue.js with TypeScript and Vue's class component syntax. After cloning the project, it should run on most platforms using the instructions below. You will need to have Node.js, Vue CLI, and Yarn installed (that should be it).

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Runs Electron with hot-reload for development
```
yarn run dev
```

### Builds for production using Electron Builder
```
yarn run build
```
